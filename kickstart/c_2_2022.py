# Alan and Barbara suddenly felt like playing with numbers. 
# Alan chooses a non-empty subset from the set of first N positive 
# integers (1,2,â€¦,N). Barbara takes the rest of the numbers (if any)
#  from the set. And then they both calculate the sum of the elements 
#  in their respective sets.

# Alan believes in a magic ratio, which is X:Y. Hence, 
# Alan wants to choose the subset in such a way that the ratio
#  between the sum of Alan's subset and the sum of Barbara's subset is exactly X:Y.
